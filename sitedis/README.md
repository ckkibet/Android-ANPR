# Number Plate Reader
Based on the idea of [**RoadwayIntel**](https://github.com/Khurramjaved96/roadway_intel), this Android App uses Google's Android OCR to read registration number from vehicle's number plate. <br />
The apps uses regular expressions to match the standard pattern/format of registration numbers in Pakistan. With little modification, it can be used to match the numbers for other countries as well. The details of the vehcile are fetched from MTMIS - provided by the Government of Pakistan - against the extracted number.
